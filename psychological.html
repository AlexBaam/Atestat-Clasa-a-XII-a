			<h2><p style="color:black;">Psychological:</p></h2>
             <b>
<p style="color:black;">Psychology is the science of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings and thoughts. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. As a social science, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.<b><br>
Not all thrillers and horror tales need cheap tricks like jump scares to be effective. Some anime achieve that eerie unsettling feeling by affecting your mind instead of your heart rate. Other anime choose drama over the thrill, telling a deep story that you just can't take at face-value.Psychological anime play with the human psyche, messing with your perception and beliefs, and leaving you thinking about the anime long after it's over.<b><br>
