			<h2><p style="color:black;">Shounen:</p></h2>
             <b>		
<p style="color:black;">When you think of anime, what comes to mind is likely shonen. My Hero Academia, Dragon Ball Z, Slam Dunk — all of it is comfortably shonen, despite how widely those titles might vary. That's because shonen really just means "for boys," making it more of a demographic category than a genre. In the age of anime as export, however, the term has gained genre connotations that cannot be ignored. When a kid loves Bleach and wants to read something else in that vein, he's going to end up searching for "shonen" — and generally speaking, he's going to find something new to love.<b>   <br>
Shonen anime encompasses an enormous variety of subgenres: Sports, fantasy, science fiction, and even horror stories are found beneath this umbrella. Compare something like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a candy-colored giant robot story, against Eyeshield 21, which follows a high school football team on their way to sports stardom. They feature wildly different motifs, storylines, and settings, and yet they are both solidly shonen. What unites them, and all shonen anime, is a focus on young men, often seeking to become the best at what they do, to right a terrible wrong, and/or to protect the ones they love. These are passionate, idealistic stories about youth at its most zealous, full of action and heart. It's no wonder that shonen is the most popular genre of anime — who can resist a hot-blooded do-gooder, whether he's a rookie shortstop, pirate captain, or wannabe pilot?<b>   <br>

<p style="color:black;">2)Black Clover:<b><br>

<p style="color:black;"><img src="imagini/bc.jpg" align="right" width="230" height="320"> 
Black Clover is one of the newer shonen animes around right now, but<b><br> it has already attracted a large and impressive fanbase. The show<b><br> started airing in 2017 and is still ongoing. It was created by Studio<b><br> Pierrot, which is the studio that was behind other huge shonen hits like<b><br> Naruto and Bleach.
Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same<b><br> church on the same day. Raised together as children, they came<b><br> to know of the "Wizard King"—a title given to the strongest mage in<b><br> the kingdom and promised that they would compete against each<b><br> other for the position of the next Wizard King. However, as they<b><br> grew up, the stark difference between them became evident.<b><br> While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and control,<b><br> Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken<b><br> his powers by training physically.<b><br>
When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular<b><br> Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing.<b><br> However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named<b><br> Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno's Grimoire.<b><br> Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched.<b><br> Though without hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he <b><br>hears Yuno's voice. Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover <b><br>Grimoire, a "Black Clover" giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later,<b><br> the two friends head out into the world, both seeking the same goal—to become the Wizard King!

<p style="color:black;">1)Boku No Hero Academia:<b><br>
<p style="color:black;"><img src="imagini/mha.jpg" align="right" width="230" height="320">
One day, a four-year-old boy came to a sudden realization: the world is<b><br> not fair. Eighty percent of the world's population wield special abilities,<b><br> known as "quirks," which have given many the power to make their<b><br> childhood dreams of becoming a superhero a reality. Unfortunately,<b><br> Izuku Midoriya was one of the few born without a quirk, suffering from<b><br> discrimination because of it. Yet, he refuses to give up on his dream of<b><br> becoming a hero; determined to do the impossible, Izuku sets his sights<b><br> on the elite hero training academy, UA High.
However, everything<b><br> changes after a chance meeting with the number one hero and Izuku's<b><br> idol, All Might. Discovering that his dream is not a dead end, the<b><br> powerless boy undergoes special training, working harder than ever<b><br> before. Eventually, this leads to him inheriting All Might's power, and<b><br> with his newfound abilities, gets into 	his school of choice, beginning his grueling journey to become the successor of the best hero on the<b><br> planet.

<p style="color:black;">2)Bleach:<b><br>
<p style="color:black;"><img src="imagini/bleach.jpg" align="right" width="230" height="320">
For as long as he can remember, high school student Ichigo Kurosaki<b><br> has been able to see the spirits of the dead, but that has not stopped<b><br> him from leading an ordinary life.
One day, Ichigo returns home to find<b><br> an intruder in his room who introduces herself as Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul<b><br> Reaper tasked with helping souls pass over. Suddenly, the two are<b><br> jolted from their conversation when a Hollow—an evil spirit known for<b><br> consuming souls—attacks.
As Ichigo makes a brash attempt to stop the Hollow, Rukia steps in and shields him from a counterattack. Injured<b><br> and unable to keep fighting, Rukia suggests a risky plan—transfer half<b><br> of her Soul Reaper powers to Ichigo.
He accepts and, to Rukia's<b><br> surprise, ends up absorbing her powers entirely, allowing him to easily<b><br> dispatch the Hollow.
Now a Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo must take up<b><br> Rukia's duties of exterminating Hollows and protecting spirits, both<b><br> living and dead.
 Along with his friends Orihime Inoue and Yasutora<b><br> Sado—who later discover spiritual abilities of their own—Ichigo soon<b><br> learns that the consequences of becoming a Soul Reaper and dealing<b><br> with the world of spirits are far greater than he ever imagined.
