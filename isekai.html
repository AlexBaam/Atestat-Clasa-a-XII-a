			<h2><p style="color:black;">Isekai:</p></h2>
             <b>
<p style="color:black;">You can't talk about fiction without talking about escapism. Isekai anime takes this to another level by building a genre entirely around ordinary people being whisked away to fantasy worlds. Sometimes they're familiar with the worlds in question, sometimes they're allowed to bring along their smartphone, sometimes they're reincarnated as a slime. But one thing holds true, across trope or plot: they were an ordinary person in our ordinary world, and now, by virtue of being transported to a fantasy land, they have become extraordinary.<b>   <br>
Isekai exploded in popularity in the 2010s. No Game No Life, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Re: Zero – there seemed to be no end to stories about world-jumping, stat-manipulating, and smartphone-wielding. But isekai has been part of anime since the beginning: Fushigi Yugi, Magic Knights Rayearth, and even Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away all fall under the genre's umbrella. Moreover, not every isekai unfolds according to the most obvious tropes available. The Devil is a Part-Timer, for example, deposits a fantastical being — in this case, Satan — into our everyday world. Demons, dragons, magic — none of those wow him like a killer deal on his fast food employer's signature salt and pepper french fries. Isekai, beyond anything, is all about watching a fish out of water acclimate to a new ocean, and that's a fantastically flexible premise indeed.<b>   <br>

<p style="color:black;">1)Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken:<b><br>

<p style="color:black;"><img src="imagini/slime.jpg" align="right" width="230" height="320">Thirty-seven-year-old Satoru Mikami is a typical corporate worker, who is perfectly content with his monotonous lifestyle in Tokyo, other than failing to nail down a girlfriend even once throughout his life. In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.
When Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skills—notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster "Storm Dragon" Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection.
Now, liberated from the mundanities of his past life, Rimuru embarks on a fresh journey with a distinct goal in mind. As he grows accustomed to his new physique, his gooey antics ripple throughout the world, gradually altering his fate.

<p style="color:black;">2)Sword Art Online:<b><br>

<p style="color:black;"><img src="imagini/sao.jpg" align="right" width="230" height="320"> 
In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid of "NerveGear" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.
Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed "Kirito," is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.
In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.

<p style="color:black;"><img src="imagini/ttny.jpg" align="right" width="230" height="320">
Twenty-year-old otaku Naofumi Iwatani is mysteriously transported to the otherworldly kingdom of Melromarc. Appearing before the King, Naofumi and three other summoned individuals learn that they are each one of the Four Cardinal Heroes who are tasked with defeating the malicious "Waves of Catastrophe."
However, Naofumi is given only a measly shield and dubbed the "Shield Hero," the weakest of the Four Cardinal Heroes. Owing to his lack of power, none of the kingdom's mercenaries wish to aid him, except for the country's beautiful princess, Malty Melromarc. But Naofumi soon awakens the next day to find himself robbed of all his possessions and falsely accused of rape by Malty.
Due to his status as a Cardinal Hero, Naofumi is not executed, but instead, his erroneous crimes are made public. Struggling to find hospitality, Naofumi buys a demi-human slave girl named Raphtalia to aid his endeavors, and embarks on a perilous journey to deliver retribution to those who ruined him, learning the secrets of this new world along the way.
